# UpDay Assignemnt

Please implement an app that fetches pictures from the [Shutterstock API](http://api.shutterstock.com/) and displays them in an infinite scrollable view. You can review [API documentation](https://developers.shutterstock.com/api/v2).
Please use the search endpoint of *Shutterstock*, making sure that new pictures will be fetched and shown when the user scrolls to the end of the list.


## Solution
I've used the search endpoint of *Shutterstock* to fetch pictures. As per requirement pictures are fetched and shown when the user scrolls to the end of the list.

I've implemented mobile end solution only, backend was already implemented by *Shutterstock*. 

I've used [**Redux**](https://blog.novoda.com/introduction-to-redux-in-flutter) pattern for app architecture because of following reasons: 
* Reason1
* Reason2
